[!LICENSE]([license_badge] LICENSE).


---

A **modular starter project** with Clean Architecture and 90%+ state-agnostic codebase (works with Cubit/BLoC/Riverpod) 
Might be as base for apps with built-in support for **localization**, **theming**, **GoRouter navigation**, 
**animations**, **custom error handling system**, **custom overlays system** and more.

---

## ✨ Overview

This project acts as a robust foundation for Flutter apps that require:


- ✅ Fully structured Clean Architecture
- ✅ Ready-to-use systems: overlays, theming, localization, error handling, navigation, animations
- ✅ Scalable modularity and dependency injection via GetIt
- ✅ In one app Riverpod as state management, in another - Cubit/BLoC
- ✅ A few features (auth, profile, password actions, etc...)


> Perfect for rapid prototyping or extending into a complex production app.

---

## 🔥 Features

- 🧱 **Core**: Logging, routing, DI, overlays, error handling
- 🎨 **Theme System**: dark/light theme, persistent state
- 🌐 **Localization**: Code-generated with `easy_localization`
- 🧭 **Navigation**: `GoRouter` with auth-aware redirect
- 🧰 **Overlays**: Snackbars, dialogs, banners via overlay engine
- 🛠 **Form System**: Validated, declarative inputs with custom field factory
- 📄 **Custom Loggers**: for lifecycle tracking of Cubit/Bloc - `AppBlocObserver`, for Riverpod - `Logger`

- 🧪 **Firebase Config**: via `.env` + `flutter_dotenv`
- 🧬 **Code Generation**: `JsonSerializable`, `Spider`, `EasyLocalization`, etc.

## 🧠 Architecture


### 🧾 ADR / Architecture Philosophy

See [`ADR.md`](my_docs_site/docs/ADR/ADR.md) for:
- ...



The app is built with strict **Modular and Clean Architecture**, following AMC principles:

```
lib/
|
├── app_bootstrap_and_config
├── core/                     # Global systems (di, overlays, navigation, theme, etc)
│   └── base_modules/         # Reusable modules: errors, localization, forms, etc
├── features/                 # Feature-driven modular structure (auth, profile...)
│   └── feature_name/         # Follows Domain → Data → Presentation layering
└── main.dart                 # App entry point with DI + observers setup
```




## Getting Started 🚀


```bash
git clone https://github.com/....git
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

For localization/codegen:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```


This project contains 3 flavors:
- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:
```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart
# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart
# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```
_\*Currently `main_production.dart` was deleted, as there is no intentions to deploy this code




## ⚙️ Firebase Configuration

1. Install deps and configure:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutterfire configure --project=<your_project_id>

2. Create `.env` file:
```env
FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
FIREBASE_IOS_BUNDLE_ID=...
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Designed with the testing pyramid in mind:

- ✅ **Unit tests**: UseCases, Repos, Providers (via injected mocks)
- 🧩 **Widget tests**: Stateless widgets & UI behavior
- 🔁 **Integration tests**: Can be added progressively

---

## Running Tests 🧪

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:
```sh
$ very_good test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).
```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/
# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
_\*Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.
